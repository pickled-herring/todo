 Usage:
	 todo
	 todo -a|--add <item todo> <date>
	 todo -d|--done <index>
	 todo -p|--push <index> <date>
	 todo -e|--edit <index> <message>

 Description:
	A simple todo script for all of your scheduling needs. Inspired by
	aesophor/py-todo but with less code and dependencies.

 Installing:
	todo is a shell script so symlink todo to a path that is in your $PATH 
	variable

	ln -s $PWD/todo /bin/

 Examples:
	todo
	todo -a "Compsci Homework" "Sep 6"
	todo --add "Call mom" "next week"

	# To get a list of what indexes to use, just run todo. The indexes
	# are in blue
	todo
	todo -d 2
	# Mark item at 2 as done
	todo -p 3 "Jul 30 2020"
	# Push item 3 to July 30 2020
	todo -e 1 "This needed changing"
	# Change the message at item 1

 Options:
    -a|--add <item> <date>    Adds an item to the todo list, if no date is
                              listed the item will have the due date of
                              "today"
    -d|--done <index>         Marks the item as done
    -p|--push <index> <date>  Change the item's due date
    -e|--edit <index> <date>  Change the message of the item
    -f                        Show items marked as done

Notes:
	Still needs some work, especially with reformatting _list_. Current
	implementation works but looks ugly as heck.
